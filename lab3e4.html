  This is some dummy text. Man I sure do love to type. I think my highest typing speed was 98 wpm but that was way back in my senior year of highschool. <br>
  I still type pretty fast but alot of the fundamentals are gone and my hand positioning is all over the place. I don't think I've ever used the left 'shift' <br>
  the way it is intended to be used. My left hand (my non-dominant hand), pretty much stays where it's at and my right hand really tries to reach over it<br>
  sometimes to grab other characters even though it doesn't need to. I should probably take another typing class or something. Because my typing could be so much better.
